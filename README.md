# Final Project
### Given an FPGA architecture Arch and a global placement solution of a netlist (V, E) on it where V represents the set of instances and E represents the set of connections between the instances. We want to perform legalization and detailed placement to find a final legal placement solution on Arch that minimizes the total HPWL of the nets.
